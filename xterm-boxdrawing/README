This directory contains a hack to allow linedrawing characters to be used on
Linux, both in the raw console and in an XTerm or PuTTY client.  It is
dependent on some modifications to the standard CRT library included with
FreePascal.

In addition, the CRT mods fix the cursor-off routines to use sequences
understood by XTerm, PuTTY and old versions of Linux, instead of sequences
specific to Linux.

These mods are specific to FPC version 3.0.0 on unix.

To use it:

1.  Obtain the files:
     fpc-3.0.0/packages/rtl-console/src/unix/crt.pp
     fpc-3.0.0/packages/rtl-console/src/inc/crth.inc
from the FreePascal sources.  Copy them into the the main gearhead
directory, alongside the existing *.pp files.

2. Apply the patch "crt.pp.diff" in this directory.

3. Copy the file "boxdraw.inc" in this directory to the main gearhead
directory, overwriting the original version.

4. Compile Gearhead normally.  The crt.pp in the current directory will
automatically be used instead of the standard version.
