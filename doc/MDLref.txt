****************************
***  MACRO  DEFINITIONS  ***
****************************

The file GameData\ghpmacro.txt can be used to define commonly used
gears. The first character in the macro definition tells what kind of
macro it is; the rest are parameters to be fed into whatever kind of
thing is being built.

"G" = Construct a gear. Parameters G, S, V descriptors.

"S" = Assign a stat value. Paramaeters Stat Number, Stat Value.

"N" = Assign a numeric attribute. Parameters G, S, V descriptors.

A parameter can be a straightforward numeric value, like "5" or "-27".
It can also be variable, read from the gear file being loaded, in which
case it will be "?". If it is meant to be read from the gear file but
has a default value, it should be a "?" followed immediately by the
default, like "?9" or "?-27".

The easiest way to figure it all out may be to go look at
GameData\ghpmacro.txt and see how it's put together.
