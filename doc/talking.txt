***  CONVERSATION  DISPLAY  ***
*******************************

The first bar in the conversation display, indicated by a smiley
face, represents how much the NPC likes your character. If the bar
is green, it means that you are getting along well together. If it's
yellow, that means the NPC has no opinion about your character one
way or the other. If the bar is red, that means the NPC doesn't like
your character, and may even be hostile.

The second bar in the conversation display, indicated by "Zz",
represents the NPC's patience.

Chatting can do a number of useful things for your character. First,
it's the best way to improve your reaction score with the NPC. There
are numerous benefits to being well-liked. Shopkeepers will lower
their prices for you, certain characters may offer you jobs, and you're
more likely to hear useful information while chatting.

Second, chatting may provide you with some useful rumors.
