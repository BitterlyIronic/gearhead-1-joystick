***  GEARHEAD  QUICK  START  ***
********************************

There are two things which really separate GearHead from most
other ASCII-based RPGs. First, movement is somewhat more complex.
Second, you get to pilot giant robots.

Movement in GearHead is a bit more complex than it is in most other roguelikes,
but once you get used to it I hope you'll enjoy it. Your character
has direction, speed, and altitude. These three values are shown in the
navigational display, on the left hand side of the character info window.
The display should look something like this:

                                  +     <- Direction Indicator
                              G  0      <- Altitude Indicator
                              S =
                              ^----------- Speed Indicator

The arrow indicates direction; in this case the character is facing NorthEast.
The number at the center of the arrow indicates altitude. If the number is
grey, it means the character is standing at that specified height. If the
number is blue, it means the character is standing at that depth underwater.
Finally, speed is indicated by the letters "G" and "S". If "G" is highlighted
the character is moving, while if "S" is highlighted the character is
standing still.

There are two ways to move your character. The first method is similar to
most other roguelikes- use the arrow keys or the numeric keypad to walk in
any of the eight basic directions. The second method is called "turtle
movement"- use the "[" and "]" keys to rotate your character, "=" to walk
and "+" to run.

***  INFORMATION  OVERLOAD  ***
*******************************

Creating a first character in GearHead may be a daunting task. There are loads
of options to choose from, eight stats to balance, and thirty skills to decide
between.

There should be a number of characters already located in the SaveGame
directory. These are the ones that I've used during play testing, so they
should all be fairly experienced. If you don't want to make up your own
character right away you can start by playing with these.

If you do want to create a character, my advice is to decide between
being good at personal scale combat or being good at mecha scale combat.
Stick a lot of points into the appropriate defense (either Dodge or Mecha
Piloting) and at least one of the attack skills. This should help you
survive until you gain enough experience points to start broadening your
abilities.

If your character is good at personal combat, the first thing you'll
probably want to do in Hogye is visit KiRin MegaMart. Here you can
buy all kinds of weapons and armor. Once you are fully equipped, head
down into the mines to gain some experience. It's been rumored that when
the mine closed a lot of heavy machinery got left behind. If you can
make it to the fifth level of the mines, you'll find out just how heavy
that equipment was...

If your character is good at mecha combat, the first thing you'll probably
want to do is obtain a mecha. You can't just find one lying around in the
street, you know. Fortunately there are a number of kind people in Hogye
(and at least one not so kind person) who will give you a mecha for free.
Head to Mecha Sporch and talk to the proprietor; say that you want to
compete in the arena, but that you don't own a mecha. He'll tell you what
to do.
