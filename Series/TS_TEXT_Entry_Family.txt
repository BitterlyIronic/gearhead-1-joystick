% Family Died Mysteriously Intro Text
August 21, NT157
  
You've lived in Hogye for your entire life.
  
It's a small, quiet village on the edge of the Federated Territories
green zone. Nothing interesting ever happens here. Life is generally
peaceful and good, though usually a bit dull. That changed a month ago
when your parents died.
  
While you were out running errands, an explosion rocked the town.
Rushing home you discovered your home in ruins. Fortunately your sister
was studying in another town at the time, but both of your parents were
killed in the blast. 
  
The investigation could find no obvious cause for the explosion.
Eventually they decided it was a faulty gas line, but you still have
some doubts.
  
Now you are preparing to leave Hogye.
