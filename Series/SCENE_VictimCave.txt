% Victim's Cave scene
%  There's been a cave-in, or a party of explorers went missing, or
%  whatever. The back story isn't important. What is important is
%  that we have a cave with monsters and 10 victims in it. The PC
%  will supposedly be responsible for rescuing as many of those
%  victims as is possible.
