	Msg1 <Hey \PC , how's your adventure going?>
	Msg1_1 <I've been thinking about looking for a mission I could do by myself but, y'know, not today.>
	Msg1_2 <When's the mission supposed to start?>
	Msg1_3 <The Musketeer gets criticized a lot but rationally speaking most high end battroids don't even come equipped with smoke launchers.>
	Msg2 <Wow, you're a cavalier, aren't you? I'd love for you to tell me about your adventures!>
    Msg2_1 <Excuse me, but I'm a starting-out cavalier, and I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about your adventures?>
    Msg2_2 <Could I ask you a few questions about cavalier life for my blog?>
    Msg2_3 <I heard that you have a real cool mecha. Wanna tell me about it?>
    Msg2_4 <If you have the time I'd love to hear all about your adventures. Uh, that's if you're not too busy, I mean...>
    % Miscellaneous Chat
	Msg3 <A lot of people don't like the Musketeer but objectively speaking it has more energy weapons than a Vadel.>
    Msg3_1 <I'm a cavalier too, you know. I'm going to go on a mission one of these days.>
    Msg3_2 <They say that this year's Robot Warriors lineup is the toughest group yet.>
    Msg4 <I wish I could have exciting adventures like that. Maybe someday.>
    Msg4_1 <That sounds awesome. I'll let you get back to work.>
    Msg4_2 <I just can't get enough about cavaliers! I'm gonna be a cavalier myself one of these days.>
    Msg4_3 <Thanks for talking to me! It's not every day I get the chance to chat with a real live cavalier.>
    Msg4_4 <Woah. Cool story... I don't know if I'd be able to handle that level of awesomeness.>
    Msg4_5 <That was so cool. I'd love to hear more stories some time later, if you don't mind.>
    Msg5 <Yeah, I understand. I've got stuff to do too.>
    Msg5_1 <Oh, right, you must be really busy. I'm just glad I got a chance to speak with you!>
    Msg5_2 <You're on a mission right now, aren't you? So cool!>
    Msg5_3 <I'll bet you've got a mecha battle to go to right now. Awesome!>
    Msg6 <Well if you're ever looking for a lancemate, I might not have much experience but I'm a fast learner!>
    Msg6_1 <Thanks for taking the time to chat with a noob like me. I won't bother you about this again.>
	Prompt1 <Let me tell you about it...>
    Prompt1_1 <Alright, let me tell you a story.>
    Prompt1_2 <Did you hear about the time...>
	Prompt2 <I have no time for chatter today.>
	Prompt2_1 <Get lost, kid. I have better things to do.>
	Prompt2_2 <Why don't you read a book instead?>
