 I know the reason for the sacrifices. I have seen with my own eyes it
 is not for sustenance that the mountain needs bodies but their genetic
 stucture, their memories, their human spirit. There is a great thirst
 here in the soil and the water, in the wind. The mountain thirsts.
 
 I have seen many years ago the fierce battle drove the mountain-mother
 underground. I have felt the sting of nuclear fire as the world died
 around us. I have been shown all this... why? So I can understand? Is
 the mountain trying to drive me mad? No, I think, it is so I will
 give myself to the womb freely.
 
 I should not have come here. I should not have taken of the blood. The
 mountain sees all, knows all of me, and as it becomes more what I once
 was becomes less. My mind will be erased until only Ladon remains.
 
 In communion with the mountain I have learned that it does fear death
 the fear is not for itself to prolong life but giving to another. It
 seeks to end us all hates what we did blind rage trapped underground
 will escape.
 
 I know I will not leave this place alive.
