August 21, NT157
 
The first thing you can remember is waking up in a hospital bed three
months ago. 
  
\NARRATIVE 5 , a trapper, found you in the wilds just outside of Hogye.
You were seriously wounded, confused and nearly dead. He brought you
back to town where the townsfolk took you in and nursed you back to health.
  
Since then, this village has become your home. You remember almost
nothing of your previous life- your name, a vague recollection of your
parents, but that is all.
