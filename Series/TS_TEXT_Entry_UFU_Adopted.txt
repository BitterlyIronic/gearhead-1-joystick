% Adopted entry story intro text
August 21, NT157
 
You first came to Hogye when you were a very young child. As an orphan,
you had no family to call your own. The people of this village took you
in and raised you among them. Since that time you've called this place
your home.
  
You have no memories of your actual parents. You don't know what happened
to them, or why they had to abandon you. Sometimes you wonder about it.
  
Life has been very good for you here, despite being a bit dull on times.
Many of your childhood friends have left home to find jobs in Snake
Lake. Now you are preparing to begin your own journey.
  
An exciting world is just waiting out there, full of adventure and
opportunity. It's time to go.
