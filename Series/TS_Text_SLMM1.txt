The most common type of mecha in use today is the Multi-Purpose
Battlesuit, or Battroid for short.
  
ITM-01 CLAYMORE (circa 24PZC)
  
  This was the first Multi-Purpose Battlesuit put into general
  production. The flexibility offered by its hands and humanoid
  form offered great advantages over the Esher and Nighthawk
  mecha which were popular at the time.
  
SAN-X2 BURU-BURU (circa 21PZC)
  
  One year after the release of the ITM-01, it was made obsolete
  by the introduction of the vastly superior SAN-X1 BuruBuru.
  
AD26 VADEL (NT96)
  
  The fifty years following the Night of Fire saw very little
  technological innovation. The Vadel was one of the first
  original GPBs produced in the NewType age.
  
Z-42k ZEROSAIKO (NT112)
  
  Emphasizing speed and maneuverability over raw firepower, the
  Zerosaiko marks a turning point in mecha design.
