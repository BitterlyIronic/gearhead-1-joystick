Once, you believed in the promise of Aegis Overlord. That's why you
joined the military.
 
It certainly seemed as though only a strong central government could
save Luna from slipping into anarchy. As wars raged on Earth, Mars, and
throughout the colonies, the Aegis promise of security and prosperity
appeared to be the only sensible choice. For a long time you served the
Aegis, loyally enforcing the will of the Overlord Council across Luna.
 
All of that changed the day you were sent to Tycho Madang.
 
A peaceful settlement, Tycho Madang had done nothing to warrant being
attacked. Their pitiful militia was no match for the superior firepower
and skill of the Aegis forces. When the local government didn't
immediately surrender, your cohort was ordered to plasmabomb one of the
residential domes.
  
You refused the order, and alerted the settlement to the Aegis plan. An
evacuation was carried out immediately. Though the dome was eventually
destroyed, many lives were saved by your heroic actions.
  
After that you had to flee Luna in order to avoid being executed as a
traitor. You came to Earth on a pirate freighter. This world is
primitive and warlike, but after seeing the true face of the Overlord
Council you can no longer believe Luna to be any better. It is here that
you will make a home for yourself, and possibly a brighter future as
well.
