% "Raid the Mansion" scene
%
% Here's a mansion with plenty of nasty guards to give the PC headaches.
% The PC can sneak in, or try to engage all the guards, or just run away.
% There are rooms that can be used by the calling function to put things
% in, and several teams to be stocked with bad guys.

%  Team 2 = Default enemies, in the driveway
%  Team 3 = More enemies, in Guard Room 1
%  Team 4 = Even more enemies, in Guard Room 2
%  Team 5 = Whatever is supposed to be in the goal room

%   V1 = Initialization Counter
% * V2 = WMon value for Team 2
% * V100 - V199 = Reserved for use by the calling plot, etc.
