ANUBIS PROJECT RESEARCH INITIATIVE #71231
  
         SUBJECT: "C.E.T.U.S."
  
Following the Nara Disaster the Hunter-X project was abandoned. In
accordance with governmental order all records were deleted and test
subjects either destroyed or contained. Secrecy procedures have made
researching the program, even assessing the damage caused by Hunter-X
biostructs, nearly impossible.
  
Containment site discovered near Wujung. Prototype exo-scale Hunter-X
biostruct parts recovered from site. Nearby community of Last Hope
inducted into Federated Territories at insistance of company president.
BioCorp research station built at containment site.
  
Biostruct identified as "C.E.T.U.S." mecha destroyer. Historic data
files recovered from site imply existance of two further exo-scale
constructs. One or more biostructs may predate Hunter-X program;
possibly PreZero weapons project.
  
Cetus implementation assessed at 85%. System identification is estimated
to be 46% complete (ref:71456.A). Possible containment locations for
Ladon (ref:71462) and Typhon (ref:71463) have been identified. Corporate
teams now attempting to secure land rights.
  
Organic myomer technology acquired from Cetus dissection ready for first
test on A.N.U.B.I.S. prototype frame. Second stage to begin with
recovery of Ladon and identification of extruded osseoform endoskeletal
structure.
