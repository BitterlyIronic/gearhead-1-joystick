:- BIOFAC LAB ALPHA
 
Though disappoingly not connected to the Triumvirate, arcotec lab site Alpha
has provided us with remarkable technology. Activation of the Triumvirate will
require the living sacrifice of one of our greatest pilots; subsequently, it
has been recommended that the BioFac technology be used to create "backup
copies". Creation of additional industrial BioFacs will be needed once the
Triumvirate Genome is isolated. Acquisition of sufficient protomass to
replicate the lost members of the Triumvirate may be problematic.
 
:- TRJ-0
:- DESIG "LADON"
:- STATUS DESTROYED
 
Our attempts to locate the wreckage of TRJ-0 have so far proved unsuccessful.
Historical records indicate that this unit's final battle took place over
Zeta territory. Repeated searches around the area of Nara have all failed.
Presumably, nothing remains of TRJ-0.
 
:- TRJ-1
:- DESIG "CETUS"
:- STATUS INCOMPLETE
 
TRJ-1 has been located in Last Hope. Zeta did not complete work upon this
unit, so it is thought to be nonviable. Our recon team will perform further
research shortly. Even if activation proves impossible, samples of TRJ-1 may
be instrumental in the replication of new units.
 
:- TRJ-2
:- DESIG "TYPHON"
:- STATUS UNKNOWN
