% Text for XRAN Plot "Last Will"
Dear \PC ,
 
If you are reading this it means that something must have happened to
us. You are likely in danger yourself. The information contained in this
letter may well be the best protection we can give you now. I pray it
will be enough.
 
Our family is the keeper of an ancient and dark secret. We have tried to
protect this knowledge against those who would abuse it, and to protect
you until such a time as you would be ready to learn of your duty. That
time is now. You must assume the mantle of protector, and defend the
knowledge our family has safeguarded for generations against those who
would use it for evil.
 
I realize that you must be confused. I regret that we cannot be there to
provide you with guidance. All of your questions will be answered in time.
 
Travel to \SCENE V1 ; you will find the first part of the riddle there.
 
With all our love and all our hopes, Mom and Dad.
